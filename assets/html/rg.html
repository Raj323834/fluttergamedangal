                </div>

                <p>Dangal Games is committed to ensure responsible gaming and is dedicated towards providing an
                    enjoyable and positive gaming experience for all our users/players. Most people play online
                    games for fun and entertainment, but we recognize that a small percentage of Users/players will
                    attempt to play despite being underage or allow playing online games to control and affect their
                    lives. Dangal Games believes in promoting a fair and healthy website/app (‘site’) for gaming and
                    entertainment through skill-based games.</p>

                <div class="subheadlow">
                    <h4 class="yelhdsd">1) PROTECTING UNDERAGE USERS/PLAYERS</h4>
                </div>

                <p>a) In order to access Dangal Games website and/or app, the User/player must be above the age of
                    18 years and/or the age of majority in his/her country of residence. The User/player should
                    affirm and certify that he/she is of such legal age during our account registration process. If
                    the User/player is below the age of 18 years and/or the age of majority in his/her country of
                    residence, the User(s)/player(s) is forbidden from using our ‘game of skill’ website and/or app
                    and he/she should immediately exit and close our website and/or app.</p>
                <p> b) Underage gaming is an offence and we take steps and measures to verify the identity and age
                    of our User(s). Any User(s)/player(s) found to be under the age of majority and/or 18 years of
                    age shall have their games/performances cancelled, winnings forfeited, deposits returned, and
                    account closed forthwith on an immediate basis. We reserve the right to report any
                    User(s)/player(s), using our website and/or app, who are under the age of majority and/or 18
                    years of age to the relevant law enforcement authorities.</p>
                <p> c) Warning for Parents: Responsible gaming means cautioning the parents for understanding the
                    importance of supervising their children’s online activities as the internet is easily
                    accessible at homes around the world. As a result, gaming companies and parents must work
                    collectively to protect children from the offence of underage gaming. To ensure the safety of
                    children, we recommend installing filtering software(s) or firewalls to block minors from
                    accessing certain websites and programs.
                    </p>
                <p>In order to restrict such usage by minors, parents are requested to:</p>
                <p>i) Not leave children unattended near electronic devices such as mobile devices and/or computers
                    and/or iPads etc. when logged into the User(s)/player(s) account on the Dangalgames.com site.
                </p>
                <p>ii) Not allow underage children to participate in any Dangalgames.com game and/or tournament
                    and/or any other activity.</p>
                <p>iii) Keep the Dangalgames.com username, password, and deposit method details private, secret and
                    out of the reach of children who are underage.</p>
                <p>iv) Counsel and advise their underage children that gaming activity is suitable only for people
                    who have attained the age of majority.</p>


                <div class="subheadlow">
                    <h4 class="yelhdsd">2) USER / PLAYER PROTECTION</h4>
                </div>

                <p>As part of the Dangal Games responsible gaming policy and framework, we offer the following
                    player protection measures to enable our customers to control their gaming activities:</p>
                <p>a) Setting Limits and Restricting Withdrawal Cancelations</p>
                <p>i) ‘Deposit limits’ allow the User(s)/player(s) to set a maximum limit on the User(s)/player(s)
                    deposits in Dangal Games over a period of time. The User(s)/player(s) can apply such a limit by
                    contacting the customer support team.</p>
                <p>ii) If the User/player wants any restriction in place permanently or for a designated time,
                    he/she shall contact our Customer Support Service team via email.</p>
                <p>Self-Exclusion
                </p>

                <p>i) Self-exclusion enables the User/player to exclude himself/herself from accessing our website
                    and/app including any skill-based game(s), tournament(s) and/or any other service(s) for a
                    period of time. The User/player can choose to self-exclude for:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>24 hours,</li>
                    <li>1 week,</li>
                    <li>1 month,</li>
                    <li>3 months,</li>
                    <li>6 months,</li>
                    <li>1 year or,</li>
                    <li>permanently</li>
                </ul>

                <p>ii) The User/player may apply for self-exclusion by informing us through our Customer Support
                    Service team. Once applied for, the User/player shall be logged out of his/her account
                    immediately without any cooling off period. Access to his/her Dangal Games account and Dangal
                    Games website and/app including any skill-based game(s), tournament(s) and/or any other
                    service(s) shall be restricted throughout the self-exclusion period, or permanently if permanent
                    self-exclusion was applied for.</p>
                <p>iii) If the User(s)/player(s) has funds remaining in his/her self-excluded account, he/she should
                    contact our Customer Support Service team within seven (7) days of exclusion so that funds can be
                    returned to the User/player. Any running tournaments played prior to the application of
                    self-exclusion shall continue to be in place and any winnings from the same after declaration of
                    the results shall be returned to the User/player as soon as the event is settled.</p>

                <p>iv) For self-exclusion due to reasons of self-control, we will take all reasonable measures to
                    ensure that the User(s) does not receive any promotional or marketing material throughout the
                    exclusion period. The User(s)/player(s) shall be aware that this may take up to forty-eight (48)
                    hours from his/her self-exclusion to be effective. For self-exclusion due to any other reasons,
                    marketing setting that was in place prior to his/her exclusion shall continue to apply unless
                    the User(s) requests otherwise.</p>

                <p>v) The User/player shall strictly not be allowed to purchase tickets, play games/tournaments or
                    to register a new account during the exclusion period. Under no circumstances would the
                    User/player be allowed to remove the self-exclusion applied before the end of the exclusion
                    period. Self-exclusion shall be removed, and the User/player account re-activated only after the
                    exclusion period has expired (for non-permanent self-exclusion only). To remove self-exclusion
                    following its expiry, the User/player is directed to contact our Customer Support Service team in
                    order to re-activate his/her account and for him/her to re-gain access to it. A one-day cooling
                    off period applies before the User(s)/player(s) is allowed to access his/her Dangal Games
                    account and Dangal Games website and /App including any skill-based game(s), tournament(s)
                    and/or any other service(s).</p>

                <p>vi) We will continue to prohibit marketing materials being sent to the User(s)/player(s) accounts
                    re-activated from exclusion due to self-control, unless and until specifically requested and
                    agreed to by the User(s)/player(s) following account re-activation.</p>

                <p>vii) If permanent exclusion is applied for, such User(s)/player(s) account shall be permanently
                    blocked, and no re-activation shall be possible and provisions of point (iii) above of this
                    Clause shall apply.</p>

                <p>viii) To protect the interest of self-excluded User(s)/player(s), we reserve the right to include
                    the User(s)/player(s) exclusion details in the self-exclusion database(s) that may be maintained
                    by: (i) ourselves; and/or (ii) authorized third parties.</p>

                <p>ix) We also reserve the right to exclude a User(s)/player(s) for a longer period at our sole
                    discretion.</p>
                <p>c) Protection of User Information
                    Our User(s)/player(s) trust us with their personal documents and information including but not
                    limited to PAN Cards, Bank details. We value & hold that trust in high esteem and that is why we
                    strive to keep the information shared with us confidential and secure. Such private information
                    is only used for the User(s)/player(s) verification purposes and is never disclosed to any third
                    parties without prior written authorization from the User/player.
                </p>

                <div class="subheadlow">
                    <h4 class="yelhdsd">3) FRAUDULENT BEHAVIOUR/COLLUSION</h4>
                </div>

                <p>i) If, at any point of time, any fraudulent activity (such as false personal details, multiple
                    accounts from same IP address, multiple accounts by same User(s)/player(s), bot accounts etc.)
                    is detected, such User(s)/player(s) account shall be immediately blocked and suspended.
                    ii) Dangal Games team monitors the gaming sessions to ensure no fraud takes place. Colluding
                    with other User(s)/player(s) on Dangal Games website and/or App shall be considered as a form of
                    fraud. We ban User(s)/player(s) indulging in such collusive activities and their accounts shall
                    be permanently blocked and suspended and their winnings shall stand immediately forfeited.
                    Further, Dangal Games retains all rights to initiate appropriate legal action against such
                    Users/players.</p>


                <div class="subheadlow">
                    <h4 class="yelhdsd">4) CASH TABLE LIMITS AND TOURNAMENT LIMITS</h4>
                </div>

                <p>Setting table limits and tournament limits provides individual Users/players with an opportunity
                    to control their spending by limiting themselves from playing certain table limit stakes, as
                    well as tournament buy-in limits.</p>

                <div class="subheadlow">
                    <h4 class="yelhdsd">5) JURISDICTION RESTRICTION</h4>
                </div>

                <p>Where a State legislation on gambling exists, it prevails over the Public Gambling Act of 1867.
                    In this regard, the State Legislations in Assam, Odisha (Orissa) and Telangana prohibit games
                    with money stakes and do not create an exception for ‘games of skill’. The State Legislations in
                    Nagaland and Sikkim allow ‘games of skill’ with money stakes only under a license.
                    Thus, residents of States of Assam, Odisha
                    (Orissa), Andhra Pradesh, Telangana, Meghalaya, Nagaland and Sikkim are not permitted to play on the
                    Dangal Games in any manner.</p>

                <div class="subheadlow">
                    <h4 class="yelhdsd">6) STAFF AWARENESS</h4>
                </div>

                <p>At Dangal Games, as part of our ongoing efforts, responsible gaming is one of our most important
                    priorities. We have regular training sessions to ensure our staff is aware and sensitive toward
                    responsible gaming issues and then take the necessary steps required to make sure that the
                    User(s)/player(s) has a safe and enjoyable gaming experience.</p>
